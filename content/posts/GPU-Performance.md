# Exploring model performance via CUDA



## MT5?

This project focuses on analyzing the output differences between MT5, with PyTorch, and compared with Tensorflow, to understand deeper which version of software is optimal for performance on a GPU cluster. 

Here's a [link](https://github.com/jprivera44/GaTech-cs7643/blob/main/Project_Report_CS_7643_NeRF_%26_GNT.pdf) to the paper from the project.
