# Exploring Transformers applied to NeRF

This page briefly describes my invovlement within the end of semester deep learning project. I reimplemented the decoder portion of a ray transformer, that focused on reconstructing the output fromt he encoder. The link to the project can be seen below.

## Encoder-Decoder

Here's a list of things I like:

* Apples
* Bananas
* Cherries

Here's a [link](https://github.com/jprivera44/GaTech-cs7643/blob/main/Project_Report_CS_7643_NeRF_%26_GNT.pdf) to the paper from the project.
