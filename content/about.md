Hello, I'm JP Rivera, a Georgia Tech graduate student and Deep Learning practitionaer, currently based in San Francisco. This is my coding blog, where I track my progress and explorations.

Through my career, I've led teams, developed and deployed machine learning models, and worked extensively with Python, PyTorch, and various deep learning architectures. My recent interest has been the implementation of complex concepts like Neural 3D Reconstruction leveraging transformer based techniques.

Looking forward to what the future can bring with AI.
